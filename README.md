Here is a "TL;DR" the current approaches to making the idea of diffusion models (i.e. noising the data and learning the gradient of the probability distribution) work for discrete data.
We can come back to this at the end of the talk.

## üîÄ Flow Matching ([Lipman et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747))

Flow matching provides a training objective similar to those from diffusion models, but applies it to the (continuous) normalising flows of yesteryear.
At a high level, the neural network again learns the small steps needed to incrementally go from a pure noise distribution $q^0$ to the data distribution $p^{\text{data}}$. 
The way we get to a pure noise distribution differs compared to diffusion models, however.

On both ends one will have noisy samples $\mathbf{x}^0 \sim q^0$ and data samples $\mathbf{x}^1 \sim p^{\text{data}}$, and the aim is to regress a neural network against the vector field that transports $q(\mathbf{x}^0)$ to $p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)$.
At intermediate "times" $t \in [0, 1]$, we have will have a probability density path $p^t(\mathbf{x})$, transported by the vector field $u^t(\mathbf{x})$, that satisfies the above boundary conditions.
The _flow matching_ objective aims to minimise
$$\mathcal{L}^{\text{FM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^{t\sim[0, 1], \mathbf{x} \sim p^t(\mathbf{x})} [ \| v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) - u^t(\mathbf{x}) \|^2 ]$$

<!-- Draw a figure of a probability distribution and a vector field, like one from [FFJORD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01367) -->

The first problem to overcome is that we don't have $p^{\text{data}}$, only _samples_ from the data distribution, so it's not clear what we should regress against.
For this reason, one would like to work with a conditional probability path conditioned on an individual data sample $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ that satisfies the boundary conditions $p^0(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) = q(\mathbf{x})$ and $p^1(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \approx \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^1)$ at $t=0$ and $t=1$, respectively.

One also assumes knowledge of a conditional vector field $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ that generates $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ through the transport equation[^1]:
$$\frac{\partial p^t}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (p^t u^t) = 0.$$

<!-- Draw a figure of a circle with some amount of stuff leaving it. -->

We will construct the target _marginal_ probability path $p^t(\mathbf{x})$ through a mixture of these simpler probability _conditional_ paths:
$$p^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)\, d\mathbf{x}^1,$$
so that at $t=1$, $p^1(\mathbf{x}) \approx p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)$.

The next leap is that the marginal vector field that generates $p^t(\mathbf{x})$ can also be constructed[^2] in a similar way:
$$u^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \frac{p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)}{p^t(\mathbf{x})} d\mathbf{x}^1.$$

Lipman et al. then show that minimising $\mathcal{L}^{\text{FM}}(\theta)$ is exactly the same as minimising $\mathcal{L}^{\text{CFM}}(\theta)$, where we regress against the conditional vector field instead:
$$\mathcal{L}^{\text{CFM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^{t\sim[0, 1], \mathbf{x}^1 \sim p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \sim p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)} [ \| v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) - u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \|^2 ]$$

<!-- Take a moment to look at this and spot how the structure of the expectation is similar to diffusion models. -->

This is great!
It lets us train a model to produce samples from $p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x})$ (by integrating $u^t(\mathbf{x})$ ), without ever needing access to the marginal probability paths or vector fields. 
We have everything we need from small batches of data.

A key ingredient is missing though: we haven't specified how we will construct $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$.
There is considerable design freedom here, so let's go back to the Dirichlet Flow Matching paper and see how they do it.

[^1]: If the transport/continuity equation is unfamiliar, it's just differential equation that expresses that a certain quantity must be "conserved".
For example, given a snapshot of a fluid, whatever the density distribution and velocity field describing the motion of small fluid parcels, we know for certain that the mass comprising the fluid cannot be created or destroyed, which restricts how the density can evolve. 

[^2]: The proof of this is short and just shows the given vector field satisfying the transport equation by taking $\partial^t p^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int [\partial^t p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)] p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1) d\mathbf{x}^1$ and substituting in the transport equation for the conditional vector field, with some switching of integrals and derivatives.

## ‚è™ Recap: A Simplex

A simplex $S_K$ in $K$ dimensions is defined by
$$S_K = \lbrace \mathbf{x} = (x^1, \ldots, x^K)^T \in \mathbb{R}^K | \mathbf{1}^T \mathbf{x} = 1, \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \rbrace.$$
This naturally emerges when talking about categorical distributions, where the concatenation of the probabilities of each class lies on a simplex.
When one-hot encoding a categorical variable as $\mathbf{x}$, the variable lies at the vertex of a $K$-dimensional simplex.

<!-- Draw a multinomial distribution with three options. Draw a simplex as a triangle in 3D. -->

Dirichlet Flow Matching go a step further and relax their $K$-class categorical distribution into continuous space by converting it to a mixture of point masses at the vertices of $S_K$, where $\mathbf{e}^i$ is the $i$th one-hot vector:
$$p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^K p^i \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{e}^i).$$
A few other approaches to discrete diffusion start with this to promote a discrete variable to a continuous space too.

Note that in the context of flow matching, this means that the transport _destination_ will be samples from the vertices, but at intermediate times the samples can lie anywhere on the simplex, like a superposition of different valid destinations.
