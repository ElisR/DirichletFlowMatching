## üèñÔ∏è  Destination: Discrete Diffusion

As we all know, generative diffusion models have had considerable success.
In its original form, a diffusion model acts on continuous data, where the noising process is easy to interpret.

However, an extension of diffusion models to discrete data isn't quite so obvious.
The allure of discrete diffusion is obvious, however, even if we just restrict our imagination to (protein) language modelling tasks.
For example, one of the downsides of autoregressive models is that inference takes an amount of time proportional to sequence length.
Producing one word at a time is contrary to how we might perceive our own sentences as forming, _guided_ by intention, in our heads before being spoken, or how we would sketch the outline of a document before filling in the details.
As a final motivator: the already-successful masked manguage modelling (MLM) objective (where ~15% of tokens are masked) looks like a one-step denoising process, so what happens if we go further?

Here, we will review [Dirichlet Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05841) (DFM) as a new approach to this problem.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Discrete Diffusion Alternatives

Here is a "TL;DR" the current approaches to making the idea of diffusion models (i.e. noising the data and learning the gradient of the probability distribution) work for discrete data.
We can come back to this at the end of the talk.

## üîÄ Flow Matching ([Lipman et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747))

Flow matching provides a training objective similar to those from diffusion models, but applies it to the (continuous) normalising flows of yesteryear.
At a high level, the neural network again learns the small steps needed to incrementally go from a pure noise distribution $q^0$ to the data distribution $p^{\text{data}}$. 
The way we get to a pure noise distribution differs compared to diffusion models, however.

On both ends one will have noisy samples $\mathbf{x}^0 \sim q$ and data samples $\mathbf{x}^1 \sim p^{\text{data}}$, and the aim is to regress a neural network against the vector field that transports $q(\mathbf{x}^0)$ to $p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)$.
At intermediate "times" $t \in [0, 1]$, we have will have a probability density path $p^t(\mathbf{x})$, transported by the vector field $u^t(\mathbf{x})$, that satisfies the above boundary conditions.
The _flow matching_ objective aims to minimise
$$\mathcal{L}^{\text{FM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^{t\sim[0, 1], \mathbf{x} \sim p^t(\mathbf{x})} [ \| v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) - u^t(\mathbf{x}) \|^2 ]$$

<!-- Draw a figure of a probability distribution and a vector field, like Figure 1 from [FFJORD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01367) -->

The first problem to overcome is that we don't have $p^{\text{data}}$, only _samples_ from the data distribution, so it's not clear what we should regress against.
For this reason, one would like to work with a conditional probability path conditioned on an individual data sample $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ that satisfies the boundary conditions $p^0(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) = q(\mathbf{x})$ and $p^1(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \approx \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^1)$ at $t=0$ and $t=1$, respectively.

One also assumes knowledge of a conditional vector field $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ that generates $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ through the transport equation[^1]:
$$\frac{\partial p^t}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (p^t u^t) = 0.$$

<!-- Draw a figure of a circle with some amount of stuff leaving it. -->

We will construct the target _marginal_ probability path $p^t(\mathbf{x})$ through a mixture of these simpler probability _conditional_ paths:
$$p^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1) d\mathbf{x}^1,$$
so that at $t=1$, $p^1(\mathbf{x}) \approx p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)$.

The next leap is that the marginal vector field that generates $p^t(\mathbf{x})$ can also be constructed[^2] in a similar way:
$$u^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \frac{p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)}{p^t(\mathbf{x})} d\mathbf{x}^1.$$

Lipman et al. then show that minimising $\mathcal{L}^{\text{FM}}(\theta)$ is exactly the same as minimising $\mathcal{L}^{\text{CFM}}(\theta)$, where we regress against the conditional vector field instead:
$$\mathcal{L}^{\text{CFM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^{t\sim[0, 1], \mathbf{x}^1 \sim p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \sim p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)} [ \| v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) - u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) \|^2 ]$$

<!-- Take a moment to look at this and spot how the structure of the expectation is similar to diffusion models. -->

This is great!
It lets us train a model to produce samples from $p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x})$ (by integrating $u^t(\mathbf{x})$ ), without ever needing access to the marginal probability paths or vector fields. 
We have everything we need from small batches of data.


[^1]: If the transport/continuity equation is unfamiliar, it's just differential equation that expresses that a certain quantity must be "conserved".
For example, given a snapshot of a fluid, whatever the density distribution and velocity field describing the motion of small fluid parcels, we know for certain that the mass comprising the fluid cannot be created or destroyed, which restricts how the density can evolve. 

[^2]: The proof of this is short and just shows the given vector field satisfying the transport equation by taking $\partial^t p^t(\mathbf{x}) = \int [\partial^t p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)] p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1) d\mathbf{x}^1$ and substituting in the transport equation for the conditional vector field, with some switching of integrals and derivatives.

## ‚è™ Recap: A Simplex

A simplex $S_K$ in $K$ dimensions is defined by
$$S_K = \lbrace \mathbf{x} = (x^1, \ldots, x^K)^T \in \mathbb{R}^K | \mathbf{1}^T \mathbf{x} = 1, \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \rbrace.$$
This naturally emerges when talking about categorical distributions, where the concatenation of the probabilities of each class lies on a simplex.
When one-hot encoding a categorical variable as $\mathbf{x}$, the variable lies at the vertex of a $K$-dimensional simplex.

<!-- Draw a multinomial distribution with three options. Draw a simplex as a triangle in 3D. -->

## üí± Modified Training Objective

DFM goes a step further and relax their $K$-class categorical distribution into continuous space by converting it to a mixture of point masses at the vertices of $S_K$, where $\mathbf{e}^i$ is the $i$ th one-hot vector:
$$p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^K p^i \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{e}^i).$$
A few other approaches to discrete diffusion start with this to promote a discrete variable to a continuous space too.

During flow matching, this means that the transport _destination_ will be samples from the vertices, but at intermediate times the samples can lie anywhere on the simplex, like a superposition of different valid destinations.

One other modification by DFM is that instead of training their neural network to predict a vector field $v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta})$, they train a denoising classifier $p(\mathbf{x}^1 | \mathbf{x}; \theta)$ by minimising a cross-entropy loss
$$\mathcal{L}^{\text{DFM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^{t\sim[0, 1], \mathbf{x}^1 \sim p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \sim p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)} [ \log{p(\mathbf{x}^1 | \mathbf{x}; \theta)}],$$
which share the same minimiser.

This way, at any point in time, the model is trying to guess the correct label of a variable.
This may remind you of how diffusion model objectives are often recast to predicting fully denoised samples at all times.

At inference time, the vector field can be parameterised as
$$v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^K u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i) p(\mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i | \mathbf{x}; \theta),$$
which is naturally restricted to tangent plane of the simplex.

## üß† _Linear_ Flow Matching vs _Dirichlet_ Flow Matching

A key ingredient was missing from our introduction to flow matching: how does one construct $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$?
There is considerable design freedom here (much more than for standard diffusion models which rely on the special properties of Gaussians), so let's focus on how the Dirichlet Flow Matching paper does it.

Before getting started, let's specify the noisy prior distribution to be the uniform density on the simplex i.e. a Dirichlet distribution[^3] with uniform prior:
$$q(\mathbf{x}^0) = \mathrm{Dir}(\mathbf{x}^0; \boldsymbol{\alpha} = (1, \ldots, 1)^T)$$

[^3]: The Dirichlet distribution is the _conjugate prior_ for a multinomial distribution in Bayesian statistics, meaning that if we started with Dirichlet prior over the class probabilities, the posterior distribution over class probabilities after observing samples drawn from a multinomial distribution will also be a Dirichlet distribution with modified parameters.
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ can be interpreted as the number of prior observations of each class.
A prior of $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (1, \ldots, 1)^T$ therefore means you pretend that you have seen every class once when drawing from a multinomial.

### üëé Linear Flow Matching

Typically, flow matching papers produce the conditional vector field $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ by defining a conditional flow map (also dubbed an "interpolant") $\psi^t(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1)$ that directly transports $\mathbf{x}^0 \sim q$ to $\mathbf{x} = \psi^t(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1) \sim p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ at time $t$, for which the vector field is
$$u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) = \frac{d}{dt} \psi^t(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1),$$
with the boundary conditions $\psi^0(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1) = \mathbf{x}^0$ and $\psi^1(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1) = \mathbf{x}^1$.

The simplest interpolant is just the linear flow map
$$\psi^t(\mathbf{x}^0 | \mathbf{x}^1) = (1 - t) \mathbf{x}^0 + t \mathbf{x}^1 \implies u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)= \mathbf{x}^1 - \mathbf{x}^0$$
Note that all points remain on the simplex, and that points always move in straight lines.

As DFM points out, however, this design has some pathological behaviour.
Looking back at the modified training objective $\mathcal{L}^{\text{DFM}}(\theta)$, we recall that the model is trying to learn $p(\mathbf{x}^1 | \mathbf{x}) \propto p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1) p^{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}^1)$.

<!-- Draw the triangular simplex, like Figure 2 of DFM -->

Now look again at the linear flow map above, which moves samples at a constant velocity.
We know that at times $t > 1/2$, a sample must be closer to its destination than it will be to wherever it started.
Hence, guessing the correct class after $t = 1/2$ is trivial, because it's just an argmax over the coordinates.
The same logic extends to other times , where as we go from $t=0$ we rule out a vertex from $p(\mathbf{x}^1 | \mathbf{x})$ every time we cross $t = 1/k$ for $k \in \{ 2, \ldots, K \}$.
This means that as $K$ becomes larger, more and more model capacity must be devoted to an increasingly brief period of time.
The vector fields are correspondingly discontinuous in space and time.

### üëç Dirichlet Flow Matching

Instead of starting from an interpolant, DFM opts for defining $p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ explicitly such that $p^t(\mathbf{x}^1 | \mathbf{x})$ has support across the whole simplex at all times.
This is defined for $t \in [0, \infty)$ as:
$$p^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i) = \mathrm{Dir}(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\alpha} = \mathbf{1} + t \cdot \mathbf{e}^i).$$
The behaviour of this it to concentrate density at the $i$ th vertex as $t \to \infty$, while retaining support over the entire simplex.
(Note the unfortunately confusing fact that $\mathbf{x}^1$ still labels a data sample, even though we have convergence at $t > 1$ instead.)

From this, they derive a valid $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1)$ (of infinitely many) that generates the above conditional probability path, starting from an ansatz $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i) = C(x^i, t) (\mathbf{e}^i - \mathbf{x})$ that still points in the same direction as the interpolant version. 


## üòè Guidance and Distillation

A wonderful feature that this flow matching implementation retains from diffusion is the capability to do _guidance_, both with and without a classifier.
They do this by deriving a linear relationship between the marginal vector field and the score function $`s^t(\mathbf{x}; \theta) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log{p^t(\mathbf{x})}`$.
This linear relationship follows from comparing the score function
$$s^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^K s^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i) p(\mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i | \mathbf{x}; \theta)$$
to our vector field equation which looked very similar.
Written as a matrix equation, this is $s^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta})^i = \mathbf{D}^{ij} p(\mathbf{e}^j | \mathbf{x}; \theta)$, where $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix and specifically $\mathbf{D}^{ij} = \delta^{ij} t / x^i$ for DFM's Dirichlet probability path.
The result is a linear relationship
$$v^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta}) = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D}^{-1} s^t(\mathbf{x};{\theta})$$
where $\mathbf{U}$'s rows are given by $u^t(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{e}^i)$.

### ‚ùé Classifier-free Guidance

Following the recipe of classifier-free guidance, if we have class-conditional and unconditional flow models $v^t(\mathbf{x},y;{\theta})$ and $v^t(\mathbf{x},\varnothing;{\theta})$, we just integrate
$$v^{t}_{\text{CFG}}(\mathbf{x},y;{\theta}) = \gamma v^t(\mathbf{x},y;{\theta}) + (1 - \gamma) v^t(\mathbf{x},\varnothing;{\theta}).$$

### ‚úÖ Classifier Guidance

In classifier guidance, one derives a conditional score function from the gradients of a noisy classifier (derived from Bayes' theorem):
$$s^{t}_{\text{CG}}(\mathbf{x},y;{\theta}) = s^t(\mathbf{x},\varnothing;{\theta}) + \nabla^{\mathbf{x}} \log p^t(y | \mathbf{x};{\theta}).$$
One can then convert this to a model posterior and then a marginal vector field.

This isn't quite so straightforward, however, because classifier gradients may have components that are off-simplex or lead to invalid negative posterior probabilities.
In their results section, they find that classifier-free guidance performs better than classifier guidance.
So, we can justify forgetting the details about how to make classifier guidance work here, but I briefly summarise it below.

One has to project the score onto the tangent plane of the simplex by replacing $\mathbf{D} \to \tilde{\mathbf{D}} = (I - \mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^T/K) \mathbf{D}$.
This matrix can't be inverted, so they instead have to solve a constrained matrix equation and again project probabilities onto the simplex.
Once we have valid posterior probabilities, we can get the vector fields like usual.

## üìä Results

A quick word about extending this to sequences: it may look odd that we have just been dicussing single categorical variables here, but in practice extending this to modelling _sequences_ of categorical variables like protein sequences is trivial.
Sequences just live in a product space of simplexes $S^K \times S^K \times \cdots \times S^K \times S^K$, with vector fields operating in a product of tangent spaces, so nothing changes there.
The difference is that the neural network gets to see every noised variable in the sequence at once, i.e. predicts $p(\mathbf{x}^{1a} | [\mathbf{x}^a, \mathbf{x}^b, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^z]; \theta)$.
